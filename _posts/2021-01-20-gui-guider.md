## Overview

GUI Guider is a user-friendly graphical user interface development tool from NXP that enables the rapid development of high quality displays with the open-source LVGL graphics library. GUI Guider's drag-and-drop editor makes it easy to utilize the many features of LVGL such as widgets, animations, and styles to create a GUI with minimal or no coding at all.

Generated code from GUI Guider can easily be added to an MCUXpresso project, accelerating the development process and allowing you to seamlessly add an embedded user interface to your application.
